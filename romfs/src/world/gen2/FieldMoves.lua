-- The seven HM field moves, as the love-free half of

-- it do to the tile", and "which line does it print when it can't".
--
-- Every routine in that file comes in two flavours and the port needs both,
-- because they are not the same routine with a different caller:
--
--   *Function / Try*FromMenu   the PACK / party-submenu path.  Checks the
--                              BADGE first (CheckBadge, which prints
--                              "Sorry! A new BADGE is required." itself), and
--                              assumes the mon is already chosen, because the
--                              party list is what chose it.
--   Try*OW                     the A-press path out of TryTileCollisionEvent.
--                              Checks the MOVE first (CheckPartyMove), then
--                              the badge through CheckEngineFlag -- which is
--                              CheckBadge with the text stripped off, so a
--                              badgeless A press is silent, not a refusal.
--
-- The two orders are the reason a tree you cannot cut says "This tree can be
-- CUT!" and stops, while CUT off the menu with no HIVEBADGE says "Sorry! A new
-- BADGE is required."  Keep them apart.
--
-- Nothing here touches love, the save writer, or the map: a routine is handed
-- a context table (World:fieldContext builds it) and hands back a result the
-- caller acts on.  That is what lets tests drive all seven with a bare table.
--
-- Result shape:
--   { ok = false }                      the event is declined outright and
--                                       NOTHING is printed (TryHeadbuttOW's
--                                       `ret nc`, TrySurfOW's `.quit`)
--   { ok = false, text = ..., badge = } a refusal with a line, `badge` set
--                                       when it was CheckBadge that refused
--   { ok = true,  ask = ..., ... }      a yesorno first, then the action
--   { ok = true,  action = "cut", ... } run it now
--
-- `action` names the World method that carries it out; everything else in the
