-- wStartDay -- the RTC reading at the moment the player answered Oak -- and
-- every read is CalcNSecsHoursDaysSince: the RTC now, MINUS that base, plus
-- what the player said it was.  That is why setting the clock to 10 AM does
-- not stop it: it only re-anchors the offset the RTC is read through.
--
-- The port has no battery-backed RTC to read, so `now` is the host clock and
-- the base is the host clock at the moment the player answered.  The stored
-- pair is the same pair the cart stores, so the arithmetic below IS
-- InitTime's, not a second clock: a save with no base at all reads the host
-- clock straight through, which is what every save made before this did.
--
-- Lives here rather than on World because two screens and one special write
-- it (src/ui/gen2/InitClock.lua, src/script/gen2/Specials.lua SetDayOfWeek)
-- and World only ever reads it.
